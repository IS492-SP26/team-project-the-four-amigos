# PROPOSAL
## 1. Problem and Importance
Starting a local business—especially a restaurant—remains an overwhelmingly complex undertaking for first-time entrepreneurs. Unlike digital startups, restaurants operate under thin margins, strict regulatory oversight, and unpredictable consumer demand. Founders must simultaneously manage ideation, competitive analysis, pricing strategy, financial forecasting, labor law compliance, food safety standards, and operational logistics. Much of the information required to make informed decisions is fragmented across government websites, consultants, online forums, and industry reports. It is often written in technical or legal language that inexperienced entrepreneurs struggle to translate into actionable plans. As a result, aspiring restaurateurs frequently underestimate startup costs, compliance burdens, and operational risks, contributing to persistently high failure rates in the industry.
This issue is particularly timely. While entrepreneurship has become more accessible due to digital tools and generative AI, the structural risks of physical businesses have not diminished. Regulatory environments are tightening, labor and rent costs are increasing, and competition remains intense. At the same time, advances in large language models (LLMs) and agentic AI workflows enable the integration of market analysis, financial modeling, and compliance evaluation into unified decision-support systems. There is therefore an opportunity to move beyond simple idea generation toward structured validation systems that can reduce preventable failure and democratize access to entrepreneurial expertise.

## 2. Prior Systems and Gaps
Recent research on multi-agent AI systems provides theoretical support for this approach. Koshkin et al. (2025), in their MaRGen framework, demonstrate that multi-agent LLM architectures improve the consistency and depth of market research by enabling self-directed, iterative query refinement rather than relying solely on static chain-of-thought prompting. Their work highlights the transition toward agentic workflows, in which agents autonomously gather and refine information to enhance analytical robustness. Similarly, Tran et al. (2025) propose a hierarchical multi-agent framework (PartnerMAS) in which a supervisor agent reconciles conflicting outputs from specialist agents. This hierarchical structure enhances coherence and produces more practically grounded business recommendations.

Entrepreneurship literature further reinforces the relevance of AI in business formation. Uriarte et al. (2026) argue that AI technologies serve as democratizing tools by reducing information asymmetry and enabling small firms to access analytical capabilities that were previously limited to large enterprises. Cai et al. (2025) conceptualize generative AI as a “co-founder,” emphasizing its potential to support first-time entrepreneurs in opportunity development and strategic planning. Moreover, Csaszar, Ketkar, and Kim (2024) provide empirical evidence that AI-assisted strategic decision-making can influence both entrepreneurs and investors, suggesting that AI can enhance strategic clarity and credibility.
Despite these advances, current AI entrepreneurship tools exhibit clear limitations. Platforms such as AI Cofounder, Canva’s AI Business Plan Generator, and Promet AI primarily emphasize idea generation, business-plan drafting, and pitch presentation. While AI Cofounder incorporates multi-agent research features, it appears to be primarily optimized for SaaS and digital startups rather than capital-intensive, locally regulated physical businesses. These tools often lack dedicated validator agents for financial stress testing, local regulatory compliance, and operational risk assessment. Furthermore, there is limited evidence of hierarchical supervisory mechanisms that reconcile outputs from domain-specific agents in a localized context. Consequently, existing systems may generate comprehensive-looking outputs without rigorously evaluating real-world viability.

## 3. Proposed Approach and Contribution
This project proposes the development of a hierarchical multi-agent AI system specifically designed to support restaurant entrepreneurship, with validation as its central function. The system will consist of domain-specialist agents responsible for market research, financial modeling, regulatory compliance analysis, and operational planning. Each agent will operate with structured reasoning frameworks tailored to restaurant-specific constraints, including cost-of-goods calculations, break-even analysis, licensing requirements, health-code regulations, and labor considerations. Critically, the system aims to make strategic decisions and insights more accessible to non-business background entrepreneurs by translating complex risk, regulatory, and business jargon into plain language.

Above these specialist agents, a supervisor agent will synthesize outputs, identify contradictions, and produce an integrated viability assessment. Unlike simple aggregation, this supervisor will actively reconcile trade-offs across domains. Importantly, it will incorporate localized contextual knowledge—such as Green Street restaurant density, pricing norms, and consumer patterns—to ground recommendations in environmental realities. In addition, the system will include a stress-testing layer that simulates adverse scenarios, such as reduced foot traffic or rising labor costs, to assess financial resilience.

This approach improves upon prior art in three significant ways. First, it prioritizes validation over ideation, thereby addressing a documented gap in AI tools for entrepreneurship. Second, it embeds domain specialization within agents rather than relying solely on parallel web research. Third, it introduces hierarchical supervisory reconciliation grounded in local context, extending multi-agent research frameworks into high-stakes physical entrepreneurship settings.

## 4. Plan for Checkpoint 2 Validation via Prompting
Checkpoint 2 validation will involve structured prompting experiments and empirical comparison. First, interviews will be conducted with aspiring restaurateurs and consultants to identify unmet informational and validation needs. Second, existing AI cofounder tools will be systematically tested using standardized restaurant scenarios to document functional limitations. Third, local data relevant to the Green Street restaurant ecosystem will be collected to inform contextual grounding.
Three prototype configurations will then be compared: a single-agent workflow, a parallel multi-agent workflow, and a hierarchical supervised workflow. Outputs will be evaluated for coherence, financial realism, regulatory plausibility, and clarity. This comparative design will assess whether hierarchical supervision produces measurably improved decision quality.

## 5. Initial Risks and Mitigation
The primary risks include hallucinated regulatory guidance, inaccurate financial projections, privacy concerns during interviews, and user over-reliance on AI outputs. To mitigate the risk of hallucination, the system will require explicit assumption disclosures and structured reasoning templates. Cross-agent verification mechanisms will reduce internal inconsistencies. Interview data will be anonymized to protect participant privacy. Finally, outputs will include uncertainty indicators and scenario-based stress tests to reduce overconfidence and improve reliability.

This project aims to extend multi-agent AI research into the domain of physical entrepreneurship by developing a validation-oriented, hierarchical decision-support system that reduces preventable risk in restaurant startups.

## Summary
This paper is a hybrid literature review of 345 peer-reviewed articles on the topic of AI-based technology applications in entrepreneurship. For this research, the authors have applied three techniques, including: 1) academic bibliometric analysis, 2) antecedents, decisions, and outcomes framework (ADO), and 3) theories, contexts, and methods framework (TCM). Using these methods, aiming to provide a picture of contemporary trends, patterns of research, and promising developments in an area that has otherwise been fragmented, while also providing future directions. The results indicate that interest in applying AI to entrepreneurship practices has increased exponentially since 2019. This ranges from its application to process optimization to its support for decision-making to the generation of promising business opportunities. Despite considerable interest, only 28% of papers have employed solid theoretical foundations.  

## 3 Insights:
1. AI Democratization in Entrepreneurship: AI enables new entrepreneurs to compete with larger firms and rivals in the business sector. Specifically, the benefits of process automation, data-driven insights, and decision-making can be provided by AI at an new business founders a critical tool to compete effectively in competitive markets without high costs.
2. AI drives innovation in business models: The review identified notable clusters of AI-driven business models and startups. For example, data generation/analysis, data aggregation as-a-service etc. Highlighting AI’s importance as also a value creator as well, not only limited to improving existing businesses.
3. No unified theoretical framework: There is currently no single unified framework across the papers. Marking the scattered nature of AI entrepreneurship research. A scattered foundation makes it difficult for these papers to complement each other and build upon them

## 2 Limitations:

1. Geographic Bias and potential obsolescence of the review: The paper under review is geographically biased toward North American and European research (the paper acknowledges this). This bias can underrepresent different cultural views and applications of how AI is used in entrepreneurial activities outside these region, including the potential emergence of theoretical frameworks. Additionally, as AI in entrepreneurship remains a contentious issue, the results of this paper may quickly become outdated.

2. Ethical impact: The review acknowledges the lack of potential long-term ethical impact on the use of AI for business. Including potential AI bias, privacy and security concerns, and AI innovation superseding human ingenuity and input. More research needs to be explored.

## Concrete Idea for our project:
Focus our AI product on the evaluation of a restaurant business. The article demonstrates how current AI products are heavily leaning toward ideation, market discovery, and exploitation for new businesses. However, technology for evaluating its feasibility has not yet been invested in. We can create a system that has a strong evaluator of a founder’s idea or a strong evaluation system, capable of handling tasks such as sustainability (ESG assessment), financial risk, regulatory compliance etc. A restaurant is a physical business notorious for strong competition, regulatory compliance (food safety etc), financial risk, and supply chain disruption. Moreover, our tool could provide stress-testing services, running simulations under specified stress conditions, such as increases in supplier prices or property rents.


# AI as "Co-founder": GenAI for Entrepreneurship

## Summary
This paper is a case study of Generative AI’s (specifically ChatGPT) use case and trend on entpreurship activities in China. The question the authors try to answer is how GenAI have contributed to creating new business/firms, and what sort of people have mostly benefited from its application as a business co-founder. In terms of methodology, the researchers collected over 12 M data points on new Chinese firm registrations from 2021 to 2024, geolocation data, and AI-related patents filed in those regions (at the time of ChatGPT’s introduction). The researchers then divided the entire map of China into hexagonal grids and analyzed each hexagon to examine new firm registrations and the relationship between these activities and the number of AI patents filed in those hexagons. The findings indicate that entrepreneurship activity within a hexagon grid is strongly correlated with the introduction of ChatGPT and GenAI, as well as with the region's proximity to high levels of AI patent filings.   

## 3 Insights:
1. Grids with heavy AI patent activity bolsters new firm registration: Research highlights how a large AI patent activity can lead to generation of more firms compared to other grid sectors. It can be inferred that, beyond accessibility of GenAI, success in its adoption is also dependent on the level of locally available expertise. 
Strong benefits to

2. Downstream firms: The benefits of GenAI are largely realized by downstream firms (businesses that directly engage with consumers). Minimal activity is shown in the upstream service (i.e. construction) that requires large capital investment. 

3. A technology that favors first-timers: Adoption has been most notably benefited from new startup founders and first-time entrepreneurs with serial entrepreneurs decreasing in economic activity.   

## 2 Limitations:

1. Geographic Bias: Similar to the first paper, the study exhibits a strong geographic bias, namely that it was conducted solely in China. It would be beneficial for other researchers to apply the methodology of this research and see whether the insights found in this paper is closely applicable to other geographical regions. 

2. Outside influences: Given the parameters of the collected datasets, the research cannot closely assess the level of GenAI use for each firm. Additionally, many findings are inferred; therefore, firm registration may also be affected by other market forces (COVID, deregulation, government subsidies, etc.). 

## 1 Concrete Idea for our project:
A holistic AI agent tool geared for first-time business founders (not serial owners) capable of providing localized intelligence (i.e., Green Street Agents).
AI services certainly are most beneficial to first-time cofounders interested in a downstream business. Our service should be catered towards those demographics and provide not only a just holistic service from idea generation to validation but even an agent with deep local intelligence of specific geographies the users are interested in entering.
